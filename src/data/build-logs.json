The more you panic, the more intense it gets. Sometimes humans just need to press a big red button and watch the world burn (digitally).",

Each frequency range maps to different hues and visual behaviors, letting people experience what synesthesia might feel like. I'm fascinated by how our brains can cross-wire senses, and I want to build something that makes sound visible in beautiful, unpredictable ways.",
